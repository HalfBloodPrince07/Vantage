Okay, the user wants me to create a comprehensive summary of this academic document about web automation. They've provided very specific instructions - it needs to be 5-10 paragraphs covering executive summary, key content, and important information. 

First I need to understand what this document is about. It's a research paper titled "Prune4Web: DOM Tree Pruning Programming for Web Agent" from Beihang University. The authors are proposing a new approach to web automation that addresses the problem of handling massive DOM structures (10,000-100,000 tokens) that current LLM-based web agents struggle with.

Looking at the content, I see they're introducing "DOM Tree Pruning Programming" where an LLM generates executable Python scoring programs to filter DOM elements based on semantic clues from sub-tasks. This is different from current approaches that either truncate DOMs or use inefficient heuristics. The key innovation is reducing candidate elements by 25-50 times, which improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28% on grounding tasks.

I should structure my summary carefully. For the executive summary, I'll explain what Prune4Web is and its main purpose. Then for key content, I'll break down the methodology, the two-turn training strategy, and the experimental results. The important information section needs to highlight specific numbers like the 25-50x reduction and the 88.28% accuracy figure.

The user wants very detailed paragraphs - I'll need to cover all aspects thoroughly. I notice the document has some visual elements in the figures showing the comparison between existing methods and their approach. I should reference those in the summary to show the practical impact.

For the keywords, I'll pick terms like "DOM Tree Pruning", "Programmatic Element Filter", and "Web Automation" that capture the core concepts. The entities section will list the authors, their university, and the technologies involved. Relationships should show how the components interact in the pipeline.

I need to be careful about the exact format requirements. The user specified strict sections with specific labels like "SUMMARY:", "KEYWORDS:", etc. I'll make sure to follow that precisely. The summary should be professional but accessible, avoiding jargon where possible while maintaining technical accuracy.

The document mentions some specific dates like "arXiv:2511.21398v1 [cs.AI] 26 Nov 2025" which I should include in the dates section. The education field should note the School of Software & QRI at Beihang University.

I'll organize the summary into logical paragraphs: first explaining the problem, then the solution, the methodology, training approach, and results. The last paragraph should tie everything together showing why this matters for web automation.

SUMMARY:
This document introduces Prune4Web, a novel paradigm for web automation agents that addresses the critical challenge of efficiently navigating massive DOM structures (10,000–100,000 tokens) in real-world webpages. Current LLM-based web agents suffer from token truncation or inefficient heuristics, leading to information loss and poor precision. Prune4Web fundamentally shifts DOM processing from LLM-based filtering to programmatic pruning, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring programs to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic clues derived from decomposed low-level sub-tasks. The core innovation is the Programmatic Element Filter, which receives a sub-task (e.g., "Find the destination field") and prompts the LLM to create a concise, task-specific scoring program. This program runs independently outside the LLM, traversing the full DOM tree to score elements, thereby reducing candidate elements by 25–50 times compared to unpruned DOMs. This approach elimin...
