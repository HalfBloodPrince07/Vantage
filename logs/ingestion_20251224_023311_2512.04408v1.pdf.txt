🧠 MODEL THINKING:
────────────────────────────────────────
Okay, the user wants me to create a comprehensive summary of this academic document about AI governance. They've provided very specific instructions - it needs to be 5-10 paragraphs covering Executive Summary, Key Content, and Important Information. 

First, I need to understand what this document is about. It's a research paper titled "Executable Governance for AI: Translating Policies into Rules Using LLMs" by several authors from different universities. The main problem they're addressing is that AI policy documents are written in natural language, which makes it hard to convert them into executable rules for enforcement. 

Looking at the abstract, they've created something called Policy→Tests (P2T) - a framework that converts policy documents into machine-readable rules. The key innovation seems to be a pipeline with a domain-specific language (DSL) that captures hazards, scope, conditions, etc. They tested it across multiple frameworks like EU AI Act and NIST guidelines, and even added HIPAA safeguards to an AI agent to measure real-world impact.

Hmm, the introduction explains why this matters - current governance frameworks are intentionally non-prescriptive, so organizations have to manually convert policies into testable rules. The authors argue this creates gaps in compliance and trust, especially in high-stakes applications. Their solution is to automate this conversion process using LLMs.

I notice they have a detailed pipeline described in Figure 1: Ingestion & Chunking → Clause filtering → Rule Generation → Deduplication → Testability tags → Example Gen. Each step has specific techniques like schema-guarded extraction, evidence gating, and SMT conflict checks. 

The methodology section mentions they used human baselines for evaluation, with inter-annotator agreement on gold sets. They also ran experiments where they added HIPAA-derived safeguards to a generative agent and measured violation rates. The results show their AI-generated rules match human standards well.

For the summary structure, I'll need to cover:
- Executive Summary: What the document is and its purpose
- Key Content: The P2T framework details
- Important Information: Specific metrics, dates, etc.

I should be careful to include all the technical details they mention - the DSL components, the pipeline steps, the evaluation metrics. The user wants a thorough 5-10 paragraph summary, so I'll need to be detailed but concise.

Looking at the document, there are several key elements to highlight:
- The problem: Manual conversion of policies to rules is slow/error-prone
- The solution: P2T framework with LLM pipeline and DSL
- Evaluation: Human baselines, HIPAA experiments
- Technical aspects: Schema-guarded extraction, SMT checks, etc.

I notice the authors released code and resources as open-source, which is important to mention. Also, they're targeting real-world deployment where failures have consequences.

For the structured parts:
- Keywords should include "Policy→Tests", "LLM", "executable rules", etc.
- Entities: List all authors, their institutions
- Relationships: How the authors connect to institutions
- Topics: AI governance, LLM applications, etc.

I need to make sure I capture all the important data points they mention - the 2025 dates in the document, the specific frameworks they tested (EU AI Act, NIST RMF), the HIPAA safeguards experiment.

The user seems to be an expert document analyst, so they'll want precise technical details. I should avoid oversimplifying but keep it readable. Since they specified "comprehensive" and "detailed", I'll include all the pipeline steps and evaluation metrics.

I'll structure the summary to flow logically: problem statement → solution → methodology → results → implications. For the 5-10 paragraph requirement, I'll aim for 7-8 paragraphs to be safe.

For the KEYWORDS section, I'll pick the most relevant terms from the paper: Policy→Tests, LLM, executable rules, DSL, HIPAA, etc.

The ENTITIES_STRUCTURED part needs careful handling - listing all authors with their affiliations, then categorizing skills, companies, etc. I'll need to extract all the institutional names and locations from the author list.

The RELATIONSHIPS section should show author-institution connections. For TOPICS, I'll include the main themes like AI governance, LLM applications, etc.

This seems like a solid academic paper with practical applications, so I'll emphasize both the theoretical contribution and real-world impact in the summary.

SUMMARY:
This document presents the Policy→Tests (P2T) framework, a novel approach to operationalizing AI governance by converting natural-language policy documents into executable, machine-readable rules. The core problem addressed is that existing AI policy guidance (e.g., EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF) is intentionally non-prescriptive prose, requiring manual conversion into testable rules for enforcement—a process that is slow, error-prone, and scales poorly. P2T bridges this gap by automating the extraction of obligation-bearing clauses into normalized, executable rules using a domain-specific language (DSL) that encodes hazards, scope, conditions, exceptions, and required evidence. The framework employs a multi-stage pipeline: ingestion/chunking, clause filtering, rule generation (via schema-guarded LLM extraction with deterministic checks and optional LLM judging), deduplication (semantic clustering), testability tagging, and example generation. Crucially, it incorporates techniques li...
