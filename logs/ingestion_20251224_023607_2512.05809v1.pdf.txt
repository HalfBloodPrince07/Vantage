🧠 MODEL THINKING:
────────────────────────────────────────
Okay, the user wants me to create a comprehensive summary of this academic document about world models and spatial reasoning. Let me analyze this carefully.

First, I need to understand what this document is about. It's a research paper accepted to the World Modeling Workshop 2026, titled "Probing the Effectiveness of World Models for Spatial Reasoning Through Test-Time Scaling." The authors are from institutions like MILA, Polytechnique Montréal, MIT CSAIL, etc. 

The main focus seems to be on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggling with spatial reasoning tasks that require multi-view understanding. They're examining MindJourney (a recent approach) which uses test-time scaling with world models to generate action-conditioned trajectories. The paper critically analyzes how the verifier component in MindJourney actually works.

Looking at the abstract, they found that MindJourney's verifier provides little meaningful calibration - random scoring often reduces answer entropy equally well. That's interesting because it suggests the verifier might be reinforcing systematic biases rather than improving reasoning. They introduce a new framework called Verification through Spatial Assertions (ViSA) that uses frame-anchored micro-claims to improve spatial reasoning on SAT-Real benchmark, but it fails on MMSI-Bench.

I should structure my summary to cover:
- Executive summary explaining what this document is
- Key content sections (abstract, intro, methods, findings)
- Important information like benchmarks, metrics, and specific findings

The document has several key elements I need to highlight:
- The SAT-Real benchmark where ViSA shows improvement
- The MMSI-Bench where all verifiers fail
- The entropy analysis showing MJ's verifier doesn't reduce uncertainty
- The proposed ViSA framework with its micro-claims approach

For the structured entities, I'll need to extract:
- People: Saurav Jha, M. Jehanzeb Mirza etc.
- Skills: spatial reasoning, test-time scaling, world models
- Companies: MILA, Polytechnique Montréal
- Locations: Montreal, Linz, etc.
- Dates: 2025 (citations), 2026 (workshop)
- Technologies: Vision-Language Models, world models, ViSA framework

The relationships section should show connections like "Saurav Jha | author | ViSA framework" etc.

I notice the user wants exactly 5-10 paragraphs for the summary. I'll make sure to be detailed but concise, covering all required aspects without being too verbose. The keywords should capture core concepts like "spatial reasoning", "test-time scaling", etc.

For the entities structure, I'll need to carefully extract all relevant information from the document. The technologies section should include specific terms like "Vision-Language Models (VLMs)", "world models", "ViSA framework", "MMSI-Bench", "SAT-Real benchmark".

The relationships will connect authors to their contributions and technologies to their applications. Topics should include "spatial reasoning", "test-time scaling", "world models", "verification frameworks", etc.

I should be careful to maintain academic precision while making the summary accessible. The user is clearly looking for a professional analysis, so I'll avoid oversimplifying the technical content while keeping it comprehensive.

SUMMARY:
This document is a research paper accepted to the World Modeling Workshop 2026, critically examining the effectiveness of test-time verification frameworks for spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Its primary purpose is to systematically evaluate the limitations and potential of heuristic verifiers like MindJourney's (Yang et al., 2025c) approach, where world models generate action-conditioned trajectories and a verifier selects helpful views. The authors uncover significant flaws in current verification methods, demonstrating that MindJourney's verifier provides minimal meaningful calibration and often reinforces systematic biases rather than improving spatial reasoning. Through uncertainty-based analyses, they reveal that random scoring frequently reduces answer entropy equally well as the heuristic verifier, exposing unreliable reward signals and action biases. To address these issues, the paper introduces Verification through Spatial Assertions (ViSA), a nov...
