🧠 MODEL THINKING:
────────────────────────────────────────
Okay, the user wants me to create a comprehensive summary of this academic document about DeepSeekMath. They've provided very specific instructions - it needs to be 5-10 paragraphs covering executive summary, key content, and important information. 

First I need to understand what this document is. It's a research paper introducing DeepSeekMath 7B, a language model specialized for mathematical reasoning. The authors claim it scores 51.7% on the MATH benchmark without external tools, approaching GPT-4's performance. 

Looking at the content, I see several key sections: introduction explaining the problem with current open-source models, methodology describing their data pipeline and GRPO algorithm, and results showing performance metrics. The paper has some interesting details - they used 120B math tokens from Common Crawl, developed a classifier to filter web data, and created a new reinforcement learning technique called GRPO.

For the executive summary, I should highlight that this is a new open-source math model that outperforms existing alternatives. The key content section needs to cover their data collection process (that 120B token corpus), the model architecture (starting from DeepSeek-Coder-Base), and the GRPO algorithm. Important information includes specific scores like 51.7% on MATH, the 120B token count, and the 64-sample self-consistency result of 60.9%.

I notice the paper has some technical depth - they compare their approach to other methods like PPO and DPO, and discuss why code training helps mathematical reasoning. The dates are important too - the arXiv submission was April 27, 2024. 

For the structured entities, I'll need to extract all the people involved (Zhihong Shao etc.), companies (DeepSeek-AI), universities (Tsinghua/Peking), and technologies (GRPO, Common Crawl). The relationships section should connect people to their roles and companies.

The user seems to want this for professional or academic purposes - maybe they're researching AI models or preparing a literature review. The strict format request suggests they need this for a structured analysis system. I should be meticulous about including all required elements without adding extra content.

I'll organize the summary into: 1) overall purpose 2) data pipeline details 3) model development 4) GRPO innovation 5) performance metrics 6) broader implications. Need to hit exactly 5-10 paragraphs while covering all requested sections. The keywords should include "DeepSeekMath", "mathematical reasoning", "GRPO" etc.

For entities, I'll list all authors under PERSON, DeepSeek-AI as COMPANY, Tsinghua/Peking as EDUCATION. Dates include the April 2024 arXiv date. Projects would be "DeepSeekMath Corpus" and "GRPO algorithm". Technologies include "Common Crawl", "PPO", "chain-of-thought".

Relationships should show author-company affiliations and the model-data relationships. Topics cover mathematical reasoning, open-source models, reinforcement learning etc. Must be precise - no fluff, just what's in the document.

SUMMARY:
This document introduces DeepSeekMath 7B, a specialized language model developed by DeepSeek-AI to significantly enhance mathematical reasoning capabilities within open-source large language models (LLMs). The primary purpose is to address the substantial gap between current open-source models and proprietary systems like GPT-4 and Gemini-Ultra on rigorous mathematical benchmarks. The authors present DeepSeekMath 7B as a model pre-trained on a massive 120B-token corpus specifically curated from Common Crawl web data, filtered for mathematical content using a fastText-based classifier. This corpus, termed the DeepSeekMath Corpus, is substantially larger than previous math-focused datasets (approximately 7x Minerva's math web pages and 9x OpenWebMath). The model is initialized from DeepSeek-Coder-Base-v1.5 7B, leveraging code training as a foundation for mathematical reasoning. Crucially, the paper details the introduction of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a novel re...
