🧠 MODEL THINKING:
────────────────────────────────────────
Okay, the user wants me to create a comprehensive summary of an academic document about causality without causal models. Let me analyze this carefully.

First, I need to understand what this document is about. It's a research paper by Joseph Y. Halpern and Rafael Pass from Cornell University, published in the TARK 2025 conference proceedings. The title is "Causality Without Causal Models". 

Looking at the content, I see this paper addresses limitations in the standard Halpern-Pearl causal model framework. The main issue is that the traditional definition of causality (HP definition) is too restrictive because it only works with simple conjunctions of events, not disjunctions or modalities like beliefs. The authors propose abstracting the HP definition to work with any counterfactual framework.

Key points I notice:
- The HP definition requires A to be a conjunction of primitive events and B to be a Boolean combination
- It can't handle disjunctions, negations, beliefs, or nested counterfactuals
- The paper shows how to extend causality definitions to more complex scenarios
- They mention backtracking as another limitation where causal models prevent "upstream" variables from changing
- The approach allows applying causality to Stalnaker/Lewis counterfactual structures
- They also connect this to explanation definitions that consider agent knowledge

I should structure my summary to cover:
- Executive summary explaining the document's purpose
- Key content sections (introduction, limitations, proposed solution)
- Important information like the HP definition constraints and the abstract framework

For the keywords, I'll include terms like "causality", "counterfactuals", "Halpern-Pearl", "backtracking", etc. The entities section will list the authors, Cornell University, and related concepts. Relationships would show how the authors relate to the concepts they're discussing.

I need to be thorough but concise - 5-10 paragraphs. The user wants detailed analysis, so I'll cover all the limitations mentioned, the abstract framework approach, and the implications for explanation definitions. I'll make sure to include specific limitations like the disjunction axiom controversy and the backtracking issue.

The response format is strict - must follow exactly the requested structure with SUMMARY, KEYWORDS, etc. sections. I'll double-check that I cover all required elements while maintaining academic precision about this technical content.

SUMMARY:
This document is a research paper titled "Causality Without Causal Models" authored by Joseph Y. Halpern and Rafael Pass from Cornell University, published in the TARK 2025 conference proceedings (EPTCS 437, 2025). Its primary purpose is to abstract the standard Halpern-Pearl (HP) definition of causality from causal models to create a more general framework applicable to any counterfactual-based model. The paper critically examines the limitations of the HP definition, which is fundamentally tied to structural equation models (causal models), and proposes an abstracted version that overcomes these constraints.

The key content is structured around identifying and resolving critical limitations of the HP definition. The introduction establishes that the HP framework restricts causality to cases where the cause (A) is a conjunction of primitive events (X=x) and the effect (B) is a Boolean combination of primitive events. This severely limits applicability to real-world scenarios...
