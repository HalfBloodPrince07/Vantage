🧠 MODEL THINKING:
────────────────────────────────────────
Okay, the user wants me to create a comprehensive summary of a research document about large language models and planning capabilities. They've provided very specific instructions about the format and content requirements.

Looking at the document content, it's a research paper titled "On the Limits of Innate Planning in Large Language Models" by Charles Schepanowski and Charles Ling from Western University. The paper examines how well LLMs can plan and reason without external tools, using the 8-puzzle as a test case.

I need to structure my response carefully. The user wants:
- A detailed executive summary (5-10 paragraphs)
- Key content breakdown
- Important information extraction
- Strictly formatted output with specific sections

The document focuses on testing four LLMs (GPT-5-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Pro, GPT-5-mini, Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct) on the 8-puzzle task. They tested different prompting methods (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and provided tiered corrective feedback. The key finding is that even with assistance, none of the models could solve puzzles when given only valid moves to choose from.

I should highlight the critical limitations they found: brittle internal state representations causing invalid moves, and weak heuristic planning leading to loops or non-progressing moves. The external move validator condition was particularly telling - it eliminated state-tracking as a bottleneck but still failed.

For the structured parts, I'll need to extract:
- Keywords: planning, LLMs, 8-puzzle, state tracking, heuristic search
- Entities: the authors, Western University, specific models
- Relationships: author-institution connections
- Topics: AI research, planning limitations

The user seems to be testing my ability to follow complex instructions precisely. They're probably evaluating how well I can analyze technical documents and extract structured information. I should be meticulous about the formatting requirements while ensuring the content is accurate and comprehensive.

I notice the document has some incomplete sections (like the "2.2 Evaluation Methods" part cut off), so I'll focus on what's provided. The arXiv date (26 Nov 2025) is future-dated, which might be a typo, but I'll include it as presented.

For the summary, I'll organize it into:
1. Executive summary of the paper's purpose
2. Methodology details
3. Key findings about model limitations
4. Feedback intervention results
5. External validator condition results
6. Overall implications
7. Qualitative failure analysis
8. Contribution summary
9. Context within AI research
10. Limitations of current approaches

This should cover the required 5-10 paragraph structure while being thorough. I'll make sure to include all the specific data points mentioned - like the three feedback levels (repeat, specific, suggestive) and the fact that no model solved puzzles with the external validator.

📤 RESPONSE (first 1000 chars):
SUMMARY:
This document is a research paper titled "On the Limits of Innate Planning in Large Language Models" authored by Charles Schepanowski and Charles Ling from Western University. Its primary purpose is to rigorously evaluate the intrinsic planning and state-tracking capabilities of current Large Language Models (LLMs) without relying on external tools like code execution or interpreters. The authors isolate these abilities by using the 8-puzzle—a classic problem requiring precise state representation, strict move validity adherence, and goal-directed planning—to directly measure LLMs' capacity for sequential reasoning and stateful problem-solving. The study systematically tests four prominent models (GPT-5-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Pro, GPT-5-mini, Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct) under three prompting strategies (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and incorporates tiered corrective feedback to understand how interventions affect performance. Crucially, the researchers introduce...
