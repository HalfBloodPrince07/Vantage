🧠 MODEL THINKING:
────────────────────────────────────────
Okay, the user wants me to create a comprehensive summary of this academic document about an AI framework for extreme weather analysis. They've provided very specific instructions about the format and content requirements. 

First, I need to understand what this document is about. It's a preprint titled "EWE: An Agentic Framework for Extreme Weather Analysis" from researchers at Fudan University and Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. The main focus is on creating an AI system called EWE that automates the diagnostic analysis of extreme weather events.

Looking at the content, I see this is quite technical. The document introduces EWE as the first intelligent agent framework specifically designed for post-event analysis of extreme weather. It's interesting how they're addressing a gap in AI for Earth Science - most current AI models focus on prediction rather than diagnostic reasoning. The authors argue that manual analysis by meteorologists is unsustainable given the increasing frequency of extreme weather events.

The key components of EWE include knowledge-guided planning, closed-loop reasoning, and a specialized meteorological toolkit. They've also created a benchmark with 103 high-impact events from the EM-DAT database. I should highlight these technical aspects in my summary while making it accessible.

For the summary structure, I'll need to cover:
- Executive summary explaining what EWE is and its purpose
- Detailed description of key sections (introduction, methodology, benchmark)
- Important data points like the 103 events dataset
- The step-wise evaluation metric they developed

I notice the document has some incomplete sections (like the "Related Work" section cuts off mid-sentence). I'll have to work with what's provided. The user wants 5-10 paragraphs, so I'll aim for 7 to be thorough but not overwhelming.

The keywords should capture the essence: Extreme Weather Analysis, Intelligent Agent, Diagnostic Reasoning, etc. For entities, I'll list the authors, institutions, and technologies mentioned. The relationships section should connect the framework to its purpose and components.

I should be careful to maintain academic precision while making it readable. The user is clearly knowledgeable about AI/ML given they're asking for a document analysis, so I can use technical terms but explain them where needed. The "democratize expertise" angle seems important for the societal impact section.

Hmm, the document mentions specific models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast - I should include those as relevant technologies. The dates are tricky since it's a preprint dated November 2025, but I'll note that as the publication date.

For the structured entities, I'll need to extract:
- Persons: all the authors listed
- Skills: meteorological analysis, AI agent development
- Companies: Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
- Education: Fudan University, University of Sydney
- Locations: Shanghai, Sydney
- Dates: November 2025 (preprint date)
- Projects: EWE framework development
- Technologies: LLMs, Python visualization tools

The relationships should show how EWE connects to its components and purpose. Topics should include extreme weather, AI diagnostics, etc.

I'll make sure to follow the exact format requested - SUMMARY, KEYWORDS, ENTITIES_STRUCTURED, RELATIONSHIPS, TOPICS. The user was very specific about the structure, so I must adhere strictly to their template. No markdown, just plain text with the specified sections.

This seems like it could be for academic or professional use, possibly for someone researching AI applications in climate science. The detailed requirements suggest they need this for precise documentation purposes. I'll keep the summary factual and comprehensive as requested.

SUMMARY:
This document introduces EWE (Extreme Weather Expert), a groundbreaking intelligent agent framework designed specifically for the automated diagnostic analysis of extreme weather events. The primary purpose is to address a critical gap in Earth system science: the labor-intensive, expert-dependent manual analysis of post-event atmospheric dynamics that has become unsustainable due to the escalating frequency and severity of extreme weather driven by climate change. The authors argue that while AI has excelled in predictive modeling (e.g., Pangu-Weather, GraphCast), it has largely neglected the equally vital task of automated diagnostic reasoning, which involves uncovering the physical mechanisms behind specific events. EWE bridges this gap by emulating human expert workflows through three core components: knowledge-enhanced planning (decomposing complex tasks into physics-grounded sub-tasks using Chain-of-Thought prompting), self-evolving closed-loop reasoning (via a unified C...
