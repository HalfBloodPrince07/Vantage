🧠 MODEL THINKING:
────────────────────────────────────────
Okay, the user wants me to create a comprehensive summary of an academic paper about "OVOD-Agent: A Markov-Bandit Framework for Proactive Visual Reasoning and Self-Evolving Detection." They've provided very specific instructions about the format and content requirements. 

First, I need to understand what this document is about. From the abstract and introduction, it's about Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD), which is a computer vision technique that allows detectors to recognize objects beyond their training categories. The paper proposes a new framework called OVOD-Agent that solves limitations in current methods where detectors can't adapt to new categories during inference.

The key innovation seems to be modeling visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) with eight state spaces. They also use a Bandit module for exploration and integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories to train a Reward Model. The paper claims this approach is lightweight (under 100MB disk space, <20MB memory) and avoids large language models.

I should structure my summary as requested: Executive Summary first, then Key Content, Important Information. The user wants 5-10 paragraphs, so I'll need to be thorough but concise. For the Executive Summary, I'll cover what the document is and its main purpose - introducing OVOD-Agent as a solution to OVOD's limitations.

For Key Content, I'll break down the main sections: the problem statement (fixed category names during inference), the proposed framework (w-MDP, Bandit module, RM optimization), and the experimental results (COCO/LVIS benchmarks). I should mention the Visual-CoT concept and how it differs from previous LLM-based approaches.

Important Information section needs specific data points: the 8-state w-MDP, <100ms latency, 100MB disk space, 20MB memory, and the fact that it works across multiple OVOD backbones. I'll also include the key dates from the arXiv submission (Nov 26, 2025) and the comparison metrics like mAP improvements.

I notice the document has some technical depth with terms like "Weakly Markovian Decision Process" and "Bandit module." I should explain these clearly in the summary without oversimplifying. The user is likely a researcher or tech professional who needs precise technical details.

For the structured entities section, I'll extract: authors (Chujie Wang, Jianyu Lu etc.), their affiliation (Wuhan University), technologies (w-MDP, Bandit, Visual-CoT), and key dates. The relationships should show how the framework connects to existing concepts like OVOD and CoT.

I need to be careful with the exact format requirements. The user specified "EXACT format" with specific sections like SUMMARY, KEYWORDS, ENTITIES_STRUCTURED etc. I must follow this precisely - no deviations. The keywords should be the most significant terms from the paper.

The user seems very detail-oriented given the specific instructions. They're probably using this for research or technical documentation purposes. I should ensure every part of the requested structure is complete and accurate. The 5-10 paragraph requirement means I'll need to balance depth with conciseness.

I'll start drafting the summary now, making sure to cover all required elements while maintaining technical accuracy. The challenge will be condensing the paper's content into the specified format without losing critical details. The experimental results section is particularly important to include thoroughly.

SUMMARY:
This document presents "OVOD-Agent: A Markov-Bandit Framework for Proactive Visual Reasoning and Self-Evolving Detection," a novel approach to Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD). The primary purpose is to address a critical limitation in existing OVOD methods: their inability to generalize beyond fixed category names during inference, despite being trained on multimodal data. The authors identify that current approaches treat detection as passive category matching rather than an adaptive process, leading to poor performance on rare or ambiguous objects. OVOD-Agent fundamentally transforms this paradigm by modeling visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight compact state spaces, enabling iterative, context-dependent reasoning. Unlike previous LLM-centric solutions, it avoids heavy computational overhead by leveraging lightweight, inference-time refinement. The framework introduces a Bandit module to generate exploration signals for...
