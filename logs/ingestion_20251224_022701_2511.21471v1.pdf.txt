🧠 MODEL THINKING:
────────────────────────────────────────
Okay, the user wants me to create a comprehensive summary of a research document about SpatialBench. They've provided very specific instructions about the format and content requirements. 

First, I need to understand what this document is about. From the content provided, it's a research paper introducing SpatialBench - a benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in spatial cognition. The authors propose a hierarchical framework with five cognitive levels (L1 to L5) and created 15 tasks aligned with these levels.

The user wants a 5-10 paragraph summary covering executive summary, key content, and important information. I should be thorough since they specified "detailed and thorough." The document has abstract, introduction, related works sections - I'll need to synthesize all that.

Hmm, the user also wants strict formatting: SUMMARY section with paragraphs, then KEYWORDS, ENTITIES_STRUCTURED with specific categories, RELATIONSHIPS, and TOPICS. I must follow this EXACT format precisely. 

Looking at the document content, I notice several key elements: 
- The hierarchical framework (observation to planning)
- SpatialBench dataset with 15 tasks
- High-level capability metric
- Findings about MLLMs' limitations
- Human vs model comparison

For the executive summary, I'll need to concisely state what SpatialBench is and its purpose. The key content section should detail each part of the framework and dataset. Important information includes the five cognitive levels, 15 tasks, and performance findings.

I should be careful with the ENTITIES_STRUCTURED section - need to extract all people, skills, companies etc. from the document. The authors are Peiran Xu, Sudong Wang etc. with affiliations like Sun Yat-Sen University. Skills would include "spatial cognition evaluation" etc. 

For RELATIONSHIPS, I'll connect authors to their institutions. TOPICS should cover spatial cognition, MLLMs, benchmarking etc.

The user seems to be testing precise instruction-following - probably for academic or professional purposes. They're very detail-oriented given the specific formatting requirements. I'll make sure to count paragraphs carefully (aiming for 7-8) and avoid any markdown.

Noticing the document has a GitHub link and arXiv date - those should go into DATES section. The "arXiv:2511.21471v1 [cs.AI] 26 Nov 2025" indicates the paper was submitted Nov 2025, so I'll include that date.

Better double-check the 15 tasks mentioned - the abstract says "15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels" but the intro mentions "15 categories of spatial reasoning tasks." Need to be precise.

For the KEYWORDS, I'll pick the most relevant terms: SpatialBench, hierarchical spatial cognition, multimodal LLMs etc. Should be 5-7 keywords.

This is quite a complex request with multiple layers. I'll structure my response to hit all requirements while maintaining academic rigor. The user clearly values precision - they even specified "be detailed and thorough" twice. Better avoid any fluff.

SUMMARY:
This document introduces SpatialBench, a novel benchmark framework and dataset designed to rigorously evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on spatial cognition capabilities. The primary purpose is to address critical limitations in existing benchmarks that oversimplify spatial intelligence into single-dimensional metrics, failing to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial reasoning abilities. The authors propose a cognitively grounded framework decomposing spatial cognition into five progressive cognitive levels: L1 (observation), L2 (topology and relation), L3 (symbolic reasoning), L4 (causality), and L5 (planning). Building upon this taxonomy, SpatialBench constructs a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark comprising 15 distinct spatial reasoning tasks aligned with these cognitive levels, all grounded in realistic multimodal video data captured from diverse indoor and outdoor environments. Crucially, the document introduces a high-level c...
